# Security Policy

## How We Handle Security

We take the security of this project seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us responsibly. We will work with you to resolve the issue.

## Reporting a Security Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in the study-computer project, please report it to us through one of the following methods:

- GitHub Issues: Please create a new issue in our GitHub repository. To protect the information, please clearly state in the title and description that it is a "Security Vulnerability," but do not include detailed information about the vulnerability in the public issue.

- Email: For a more secure way to report, you can send the details to [Please replace with your email address here].

In your report, please describe the issue you've found in as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce, the affected parts of the project, and the potential impact you believe it could have.

### Third-Party Dependencies

This project is built using Docusaurus. If you find a security vulnerability in Docusaurus itself, please report it to the Docusaurus team directly. You can find their security policy and reporting guidelines on the [Docusaurus GitHub repository](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus).

### Supported Versions

As this is a personal learning project, we primarily maintain and update the current latest version.

|Branch|Supported|
|------|----------|
|main  |:white_check_mark:     |
|Other branches|:x:|

We recommend that you always use the latest code from the `main` branch to ensure you have the latest features and security fixes.

### Security Updates

Once we have confirmed a vulnerability and developed a patch, we will merge it into the `main` branch as soon as possible. We recommend that you regularly `git pull` to get the latest code.

Since this is a personal project, we may not have a fixed update schedule, but we will do our best to address vulnerability reports in a timely manner after receiving them.

Thank you for your contribution to the security of the `study-computer` project!
